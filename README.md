# PersonalProject
 Just a personal project I'm working on.

 For this project, I'm using a plugin for the first person character in true firstperson perspective. It isn't exactly what I need but is enough to begin with. I will have to create my own after I'm done with the basic stuff. I'm working on a combat system that I want to implement in a "imaginary RPG" game. This rpg will be first person, will be using Gameplay ability system for player stats. Items and inventory sistem that I will be creating. An equipment system. and AI to start with the combat system.

This code just implement the player character and an interaction system to interact with items in the world. Next step would be the equipment to be able to equip a weapon. And I will be implementing step by step and updating it in this repo.
